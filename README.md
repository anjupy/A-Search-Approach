# A* Search Approach
 A* Search Algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm used in artificial intelligence and robotics. It efficiently finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph, considering both the cost of reaching each node and the estimated cost from that node to the goal.

 This repository contains a Python implementation of the A* search algorithm, which you can use to find optimal paths in your own graphs.
## Getting Started:
To use this implementation, you'll need Python installed on your machine.
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/astar-search.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd astar-search
3. Run the A* algorithm:
python astar.py
4. We can also write this code in jupyter notebook or any other python suppporting tools.
5. Follow the prompts to input your graph details, including start and goal nodes, edge costs, and heuristic values.
